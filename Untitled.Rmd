## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
pge_20_q1_elec <- read_csv("PGE_2020_Q1_ElectricUsageByZip.csv")
write_csv(pge_20_q1_elec, "PGE_2020")
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

year <- 2020
quarters <- 1:4
type <- "Electric"

pge_20_elec <- NULL

for(quarter in quarters) {
  
  filename <- 
    paste0(
      "pge/PGE_",
      year,
      "_Q",
      quarter,
      "_",
      type,
      "UsageByZip.csv"
    )

  print(filename)
  
  temp <- read_csv(filename)
  
  pge_20_elec <- rbind(pge_20_elec,temp)
  # Note rbind requires field names to be consistent for every new thing that you add.

  saveRDS(pge_20_elec, "pge_20_elec.rds")
}
```

```{r}
pge_filter <- 
  filter(
    pge_20_elec,
    CUSTOMERCLASS %in% 
      c(
        "Elec- Residential",
        "Elec- Commercial"
      )
  )
```

```{r}
names(pge_filter)
head(pge_filter)
```

```{r}
pge_filter[1:5, ]$YEAR
```

```{r}
pge_select <-
  select(
    pge_filter,
    -c(YEAR, COMBINED, AVERAGEKWH)
  )
```

```{r}
pge_group <-
  group_by(
    pge_select,
    MONTH,
    CUSTOMERCLASS
  )
```

```{r}
pge_summarize <-
  summarize(
    pge_group,
    TOTALKWH = 
      sum(
        TOTALKWH, 
        na.rm = T
      ),
    TOTALCUSTOMERS =
      sum(
        TOTALCUSTOMERS,
        na.rm = T
      )
  )

pge_mutate <-
  mutate(
    pge_summarize,
    AVERAGEKWH =
      TOTALKWH/TOTALCUSTOMERS
  )
```

```{r}
pge_wide <-
  pivot_wider(
    pge_summarize,
    names_from = CUSTOMERCLASS,
    values_from = TOTALKWH
  )

pge_wide
```

```{r}
pge_tidy <-
  pivot_longer(
    pge_wide,
    c("Elec- Commercial", "Elec- Residential"),
    names_to = "CUSTOMERCLASS",
    values_to = "TOTALKWH"
  )
```

```{r}
pge_final <-
  pge_20_elec %>% 
  filter(
    CUSTOMERCLASS %in% 
      c(
        "Elec- Residential",
        "Elec- Commercial"
      )
  ) %>% 
  select(
    -c(YEAR, COMBINED, AVERAGEKWH)
  ) %>% 
  group_by(MONTH, CUSTOMERCLASS) %>% 
  summarize(
    TOTALKWH = 
      sum(
        TOTALKWH, 
        na.rm = T
      ),
    TOTALCUSTOMERS =
      sum(
        TOTALCUSTOMERS,
        na.rm = T
      )
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    AVERAGEKWH =
      TOTALKWH/TOTALCUSTOMERS
  )

pge_final
```

```{r}
library(plotly)

pge_chart <-
  pge_final %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(
    aes(
      x = MONTH,
      y = TOTALKWH,
      fill = CUSTOMERCLASS
    ),
    stat = "identity",
    position = "stack"
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Month",
    y = "kWh",
    title = "PG&E Territory Monthly Electricity Usage, 2019",
    fill = "Electricity Type"
  )

pge_chart %>% ggplotly()
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
